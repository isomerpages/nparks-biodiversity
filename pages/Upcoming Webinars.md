| 21 May 2022 (Saturday) 3pm – 4pm  | **OneMillionTrees webinar – Living the high life: Epiphytes in our midst.** Did you know that our majestic trees provide homes for a rich diversity of native epiphytic plants? Delicate orchids and sprawling hoyas are a few of them! Having developed remarkable adaptations for aboveground living, these canopy dwellers come in fascinating shapes and forms, but easily go unnoticed among the trunks and branches of our trees. | Click [here](https://form.gov.sg/#!/624b908af3d5010013735b95) to register and find more information. |
