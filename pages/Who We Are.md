The Festival of Biodiversity is an annual event organised by the National Parks Board in collaboration with the Biodiversity Roundtable to celebrate Singapore's biodiversity. The Festival aims to create awareness and foster a sense of appreciation for our natural heritage.

Since its initiation in 2012, the Festival has garnered the support of many biodiversity-related interest groups and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). These groups play a crucial role in creating awareness about our island’s biodiversity and enthuse the public in being part of the various conservation efforts.

If you are interested to discover ways that you can contribute to conserving and protecting our nation’s precious natural heritage, visit the Festival Programmes to see what activities and booths you can take part in!

Festival of Biodiversity kicks off this year on the 22 and 23 May at the Forest Discovery Centre @ OCBC Arboretum with various exciting booths and activities for you to take part in. For those who would wish to engage in the festivities from home, do check out some of the online activities to learn more on our natural heritage!
