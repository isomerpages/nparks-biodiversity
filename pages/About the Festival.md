<p>The Festival of Biodiversity is an annual event which aims to create awareness
and foster a sense of appreciation for our natural heritage. Visitors will
be presented with a range of activities for all ages at the Festival.</p>
<p>Initiated in 2012, the Festival of Biodiversity is organised by the National
Parks Board in collaboration with the Biodiversity Roundtable and is the
biggest biodiversity festival in Singapore. The Biodiversity Roundtable
is an initiative which includes more than 20 Non-Governmental Organisations
(NGOs) involved in local biodiversity issues, and NParks.</p>
<p>Since its initiation, the Festival has garnered the support of many biodiversity-related
interest groups and NGOs. These groups play a crucial role in creating
awareness about our island’s biodiversity and in nurturing our City in
Nature vision.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up 2024's Festival of Biodiversity</h2>
<p>This year’s Festival of Biodiversity (FoB), held on 25 and 26 May at One
Punggol drew nature enthusiasts of all ages to celebrate Singapore’s rich
and diverse flora and fauna.</p>
<p>At the launch of the 13th edition of FoB, updates on biodiversity conservation
efforts by NParks and the community were announced by Guest-of-Honour,
President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who was hosted by Minister for National
Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration, Mr Desmond
Lee. This included the success of ex-situ conservation efforts for all
three of Singapore’s endemic freshwater crabs in the Species Recovery Programme,
the completion of the third and most comprehensive edition of the Singapore
Red Data Book (RDB3), and the revision of the NParks’ Biodiversity Impact
Assessment (BIA) guidelines. President Tharman also presented awards to
the winners of NParks’ Community in Nature Schools Award 2024, which received
a total of 70 nominations across educational levels from preschools to
junior colleges, up from 65 in 2022 and 44 in 2020.</p>
