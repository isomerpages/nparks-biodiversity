The Festival of Biodiversity is an annual event which aims to create awareness and foster a sense of appreciation for our natural heritage. Visitors can look forward to a range of online and on site activities for all ages at this year's Festival. 

Initiated in 2012, the Festival of Biodiversity is organised by the National Parks Board in collaboration with the Biodiversity Roundtable. The Biodiversity Roundtable is an initiative which includes more than 20 non-governmental organisations involved in local biodiversity issues, and NParks.

Since its initiation, the Festival has garnered the support of many biodiversity-related interest groups and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). These groups play a crucial role in creating awareness about our islandâ€™s biodiversity and in nurturing our City in Nature vision.
