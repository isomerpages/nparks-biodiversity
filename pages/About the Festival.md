The Festival of Biodiversity is an annual event which aims to create awareness and foster a sense of appreciation for our natural heritage. Visitors will be presented with a range of activities for all ages at the Festival.

Initiated in 2012, the Festival of Biodiversity is organised by the National Parks Board in collaboration with the Biodiversity Roundtable and is the biggest biodiversity festival in Singapore. The Biodiversity Roundtable is an initiative which includes more than 20 Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) involved in local biodiversity issues, and NParks.

Since its initiation, the Festival has garnered the support of many biodiversity-related interest groups and NGOs. These groups play a crucial role in creating awareness about our island’s biodiversity and in nurturing our City in Nature vision.

## Wrapping up 2024's Festival of Biodiversity


This year’s Festival of Biodiversity (FoB), held on 25 and 26 May at One Punggol drew nature enthusiasts of all ages to celebrate Singapore’s rich and diverse flora and fauna.

At the launch of the 13th edition of FoB, updates on biodiversity conservation efforts by NParks and the community were announced by Guest-of-Honour, President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who was hosted by Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration, Mr Desmond Lee. This included the success of ex-situ conservation efforts for all three of Singapore’s endemic freshwater crabs in the Species Recovery Programme, the completion of the third and most comprehensive edition of the Singapore Red Data Book (RDB3), and the revision of the NParks’ Biodiversity Impact Assessment (BIA) guidelines. President Tharman also presented awards to the winners of NParks’ Community in Nature Schools Award 2024, which received a total of 70 nominations across educational levels from preschools to junior colleges, up from 65 in 2022 and 44 in 2020.

With over 20 nature groups offering fun, interactive booths, workshops, and spotlight talks to educate and inspire attendees about the importance of biodiversity conservation, the festival brought together a diverse group of people united by a common passion for nature and a commitment to conservation. Volunteers from various nature groups, schools, and communities volunteered their time and effort, demonstrating the power of collective action in biodiversity conservation.
