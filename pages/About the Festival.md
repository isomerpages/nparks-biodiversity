<p>The Festival of Biodiversity is an annual event which aims to create awareness
and foster a sense of appreciation for our natural heritage. Visitors will
be presented with a range of activities for all ages at the Festival.</p>
<p>Initiated in 2012, the Festival of Biodiversity is organised by the National
Parks Board in collaboration with the Biodiversity Roundtable and is the
biggest biodiversity festival in Singapore. The Biodiversity Roundtable
is an initiative which includes more than 20 Non-Governmental Organisations
(NGOs) involved in local biodiversity issues, and NParks.</p>
<p>Since its initiation, the Festival has garnered the support of many biodiversity-related
interest groups and NGOs. These groups play a crucial role in creating
awareness about our island’s biodiversity and in nurturing our City in
Nature vision.</p>
