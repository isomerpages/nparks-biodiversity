The Festival of Biodiversity is an annual event organised by the National Parks Board in collaboration with the Biodiversity Roundtable. Initiated in 2012, the Festival aims to create awareness and foster a sense of appreciation for our natural heritage.

Since its initiation, the Festival has garnered the support of many biodiversity-related interest groups and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs). These groups play a crucial role in creating awareness about our islandâ€™s biodiversity and in promoting various conservation efforts.

This event celebrates Singapore's natural heritage and in doing so, we hope to bring about greater awareness of the biodiversity that Singapore has. Visitors can look forward to a range of online and on site activities for all ages at this year's Festival.
