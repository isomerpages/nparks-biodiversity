<p>The kingdom of Fungi, making up one of the five kingdoms of living beings,
has an estimated 3.8 million species.</p>
<p>These fungi range from edible mushrooms that routinely sprout after rain,
to fungi that exist underground for their entire lifecycle.</p>
<p>Fungi/mushrooms have been used for different medicinal purposes, be it
in traditional Chinese medicine (Eg: Gandoderma and Cordyceps) to modern
western medication (Eg: Penicillin from Penicillum chrysogenum).</p>
<p>In addition to existing independently, an estimated 80+% of existing plant
species form symbiotic relationships with fungi within their roots. Join
us for a glimpse into the fascinating fungal world.</p>

<p>Horseshoe crabs are ancient arthropods that have roamed the Earth for
over 450 million years. Interestingly, they are also not true crabs but
are more related to spiders and scorpions. This talk explores the remarkable
biology, history, and ecological significance of these creatures. We will
delve into the fascinating features of horseshoe crabs, including their
unique anatomy, behaviour, and the important role they play in the marine
ecosystem.</p>
<p>Additionally, the talk will address the conservation challenges horseshoe
crabs face, including the impact of overharvesting and habitat loss on
their populations, and the measures being taken to protect them.</p>
<p>By the end of the session, participants will gain a deep appreciation
for these “living fossils”, their critical role in modern medicine, and
the ongoing efforts to ensure their survival in the face of increasing
environmental pressures.</p>

<p>Phytoplankton play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems and sequester carbon
dioxide in our atmosphere. More than 50% of our oxygen comes from phytoplankton

<p>This programme is part of a series on sustainability co-curated with the

<p></p>
<p>About the Speaker:</p>
<p>Dr. Maxine Mowe is a biology lecturer at the National University of Singapore
in the Department of Biological Sciences and has more than 14 years of
research experience in aquatic biology specifically in phytoplankton and
zooplankton ecology and has been a lecturer since 2019. She has worked
on the ecology of several cyanobacterial taxa (Microcystis, Raphidiopsis),
phytoplankton and zooplankton interactions, microplastic impacts and eutrophication
and algal bloom mitigation using aquatic plants in Singapore’s reservoirs
and coastal environment. She teaches various biology and ecology courses
(General Biology, Evolutionary Biology, Freshwater Biology, Plankton Ecology)
for undergraduate students and several courses (Freshwater Conservation,
Food Security and Sustainability and Internships) for the Masters’ programme
in NUS on Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainability. She is also a voluntary
committee member for Care for Creation Committee at Caritas since 1 January
2023. Together with the rest of the committee, she has planned several
environmental activities including beach clean-ups, intertidal walks, tree
planting events and workshops for adults and children.</p>

<p>In this workshop, you'll learn why biodiversity is vital for the wellbeing
&amp; preservation of our societal ecosystems. The challenge lies in balancing
urban demand for natural resources/services with a need to protect nature.</p>
<p>Through this hands-on interactive workshop, we'll unpack our interdependence
with nature &amp; how human activities are contributing to biodiversity
loss. Learn about the interconnectedness of all life on Earth. Thanks to
a science-based set of cards (based on the IPBES reports), discover the
fundamental interactions within biodiversity, the causes and consequences
of its decline. Discover how our societies and even health systems depend
very much on nature.</p>

<p>The latest exhibition at the Singapore Botanic Gardens’ CDL Green Gallery, <strong>‘We Love Our Planet,’</strong> shines
a spotlight on the indispensable role of nature in our lives. Despite its
profound importance, nature is often undervalued and taken for granted.
Yet, restoring the delicate balance between nature and society has never
been more urgent to ensure the well-being of both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In collaboration with 24 international and local organisations,
this exhibition highlights the critical role of biodiversity in supporting
ecosystem resilience and combating the climate crisis. It celebrates Southeast
Asia’s rich natural heritage while showcasing Singapore's ongoing conservation
efforts and the global call for ecosystem restoration, aligned with the
Singapore Green Plan 2030.</p>

<p>The Singapore Botanic Gardens' Rain Forest is one of the oldest remnants
of primary rain forests in Singapore. Spanning 6.2 hectares, it is home
to over 300 species of plants, including majestic, mature dipterocarps.
This rain forest is part of the original lowland dipterocarp forest that
once covered much of the island, a natural heritage preserved by successive
directors of the Gardens . The OCBC Arboretum in the Singapore Botanic
Gardens, managed by NParks, is Southeast Asia’s first high-tech conservation
initiative for dipterocarps. The Arboretum houses 200 species of dipterocarps
and employs an Internet of Things (IoT) system to remotely and continuously
monitor tree growth and environmental conditions.&nbsp;
<br>This exhibition invites you to explore the rich history, ecological importance,
and versatile uses of dipterocarps. Join us to uncover the stories of these
forest giants and their lasting impact on our environment and heritage.</p>

as a treasured symbol of our City in Nature.
<br>We’re also celebrating 150 years of the Singapore Herbarium and the Library
of Botany and Horticulture, along with 30 years of the National Orchid
Garden—cornerstones of the Gardens’ research, education and conservation
work. These milestones coincide with Singapore’s 60th year of independence,
making this a truly special occasion!
<br>Join us for a year-long celebration! Kicking off with the Singapore Botanic

<p>The Singapore Herbarium (SING) was established in 1875 by James Henry
Murton, marking the beginning of scientific research at the Singapore Botanic
Gardens. What began as a limited collection of specimens in Murton’s office
has grown into collection of approximately 800,000 specimens. Today, the
Singapore Herbarium is recognised as the one of the largest and most important
herbaria in our biodiverse Southeast Asian region.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>Our collection played an important role in securing the UNESCO World Heritage
status for the Singapore Botanic Gardens in 2015. To ensure the Herbarium
is preserved for future generations, we are continuously enhancing and
expanding our facilities.&nbsp;
<br>In celebration of the Herbarium’s 150th anniversary, we are embarking
on an ambitious digitisation project to make our specimens freely accessible
online.</p>
