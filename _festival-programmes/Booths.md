Animals in particular are used as food, medicine, pets and for display as fashion or cultural items. The Illegal wildlife trade has become the second largest direct threat to the world’s most threatened species after habitat loss. In Southeast Asia alone, there has been a dramatic decline in the populations of many species with high commercial value, many of which are now rare, endangered or locally extinct such as the Tiger, Sumatran and Javan Rhinoceros, Asian Elephant and pangolins. Come join WWF in its fight to save threatened species and learn about what you can do to stop the trade!
