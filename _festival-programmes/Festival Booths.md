|![](/images/Logos/mandai-nature.jpg)|**[Mandai Nature](https://www.mandainature.org/en/home.html).** Snakes, wild boars and birds, what animals have you met on a walk, or even near your home?  In a vision to transform Singapore to a city in nature, green spaces extend amidst the built environment, creating safe connectivity between landscapes for wildlife. Having to share our spaces with native wildlife means needing to be more tolerant of their presence as our paths cross more frequently. But, the lack of understanding and preparedness of what we should do during encounters with wildlife have led to an increasing trend of public concerns on wildlife sightings. The Our Wild Neighbours (OWN) initiative is a consolidated country-wide outreach programme to promote co-existence with Singapore's native wildlife. OWN is a partnership across numerous conservation organisations. Come learn more at the Mandai Nature booth.|

Animals in particular are used as food, medicine, pets and for display as fashion or cultural items. The Illegal wildlife trade has become the second largest direct threat to the world’s most threatened species after habitat loss. In Southeast Asia alone, there has been a dramatic decline in the populations of many species with high commercial value, many of which are now rare, endangered or locally extinct such as the Tiger, Sumatran and Javan Rhinoceros, Asian Elephant and pangolins. Come join WWF in its fight to save threatened species and learn about what you can do to stop the trade|
