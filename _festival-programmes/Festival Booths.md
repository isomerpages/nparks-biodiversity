|![](/images/book%20a%20tree%20logo%202.png)| **Book A Tree**. Book-A-Tree is a movement to support NParks in their mission to plant 1 million trees around Singapore to further enhance its status as a garden city. The movement is supported by the sales of the book "God's Own Design - A Photographic Journey Through Nature". All proceeds from the book sales would be donated to the Garden City Fund's Plant-A-Tree Programme. Specially created for those who love nature, the book "God's Own Design - A Photographic Journey Through Nature" is a visual treat from Singapore’s parks and nature reserves, punctuated with inspiring quotations. If you’re a tourist and wish to bring back a slice of Singapore with you, this book is just the perfect choice. If you’re living here, the book offers a beautiful way to both embrace and contribute toward Singapore’s natural beauty. When you buy the book, you’re also booking a tree because your contributions go towards planting new saplings that would be trees one day. Please join the Book-A-Tree movement and give birth to new trees, making Singapore even greener.|
