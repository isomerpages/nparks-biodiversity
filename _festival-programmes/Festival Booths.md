|![](/images/Logos/mandai-nature.jpg)|**[Mandai Nature](https://www.mandainature.org/en/home.html).** Snakes, wild boars and birds, what animals have you met on a walk, or even near your home?  In a vision to transform Singapore to a city in nature, green spaces extend amidst the built environment, creating safe connectivity between landscapes for wildlife. Having to share our spaces with native wildlife means needing to be more tolerant of their presence as our paths cross more frequently. But, the lack of understanding and preparedness of what we should do during encounters with wildlife have led to an increasing trend of public concerns on wildlife sightings. The Our Wild Neighbours (OWN) initiative is a consolidated country-wide outreach programme to promote co-existence with Singapore's native wildlife. OWN is a partnership across numerous conservation organisations. Come learn more at the Mandai Nature booth.|
