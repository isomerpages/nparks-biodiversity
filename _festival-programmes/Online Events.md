That’s not all! Over the years, we have made a concerted effort to apply science and technology in our various areas of work, from biodiversity conservation to park and greenery management. This helps us address the challenges of urbanisation and climate change, and sets the foundation for further realisation of our City in Nature vision.

|**Our Green Spaces for the Future** - NParks City in Nature Webinar Series|Imagine a future where a park is within a 10-minute walk from your home or 500km of park connectors and recreational trails that take you on a nature adventure all over the island. This is our green spaces for the future and we want to share that vision with you. As we work towards building a City in Nature in Singapore, we hope to restore nature into the urban environment and bring recreational opportunities closer to people as recent surveys have shown that parks have become important places of respite amidst the stresses of urban living and the ongoing pandemic. Join us for the first of our NParks City in Nature webinar series entitled “Green Spaces for the Future” where speaker **Ong Chong Ren, Centre Director of Jurong Lake Gardens Development** will share with you how we are developing parks for the future and how you can be a part of all that.
