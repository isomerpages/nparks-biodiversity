<p><strong>The Fussy Juvenile Horseshoe Crab at Chek Jawa </strong>with Nature
Society Singapore and Dunman Secondary School</p>
<p></p>
<p>The workshop is designed to captivate and educate children aged 5 to 12,
revolving around the delightful narrative of "No Worms for Dinner." Dunman
Secondary School students will bring the book to life through storytelling.
Following the narrative journey, participants will be invited to consolidate
their newfound knowledge through a thoughtfully constructed quiz in a fun
and interactive manner. To further enrich this experience, the workshop
will include a hands-on coloring activity, carefully curated to spotlight
key characters from the book. This aims to reinforce the children's connection
with the story, enhancing their understanding and appreciation of the narrative's
nuances. Through this multifaceted approach, the workshop aims to foster
a love for reading, stimulate imaginative thinking, and cultivate artistic
skills among its youthful participants.</p>
