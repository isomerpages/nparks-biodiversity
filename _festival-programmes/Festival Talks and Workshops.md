<p><strong>Marine Talk for Kids</strong>
</p>
<p>Meet the biologists, scientists, researchers and science educators of
the marine community and hear them share about the wonderful world of marine
life and habitats. They will be sharing on the fascinating corals and coral
reefs, the witty octopuses and incredible giant clams, the charismatic
sea turtles, the amazing mangroves and last but not least, the impact of
unforgiving marine trash on our marine environment. What can we do to help
protect our marine environment to give the marine animals healthy homes?</p>

<p><strong>Perspectives from LKCNHM: Archiving our Historical Biodiversity</strong>
</p>
<p>The Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum is Singapore’s only natural
history museum, and a leading institution in Southeast Asian biodiversity
research, education, and outreach. Located at the National University of
Singapore, over a million biological specimens, artefacts, field notes,
drawings, and photographs from Southeast Asia are housed in our iconic
rock-shaped building. As safe-keepers of Singapore’s natural heritage,
we not only seek to share knowledge with the public, but also recognise
the value of our collections among the scientific community and support
biodiversity research in Singapore and in the region. This talk will share
about LKCNHM’s role in archiving our historical biodiversity, specific
to a wild Punggol in the past and present and our ongoing digitisation
programmes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Discovering the Bees of Singapore</strong>
</p>
<p>From magnificent carpenters to minuscule ground-dwellers, Singapore hosts
an impressive array of bee species that inhabit our parks, forests, mangroves,
and urban gardens. Despite their crucial role as pollinators, bees are
frequently misunderstood or overlooked. Join us as we unveil the fascinating
diversity of these beneficial insects, and learn how you can actively contribute
to expanding our understanding of them!</p>

<p>by Nature Society Singapore and students from Dunman Secondary School</p>
<p></p>
<p>This workshop is designed to captivate and educate children aged 5 to
12, revolving around the delightful narrative of "No Worms for Dinner."
Dunman Secondary School students will bring the book to life through storytelling.
Following the narrative journey, participants will be invited to consolidate
their newfound knowledge through a thoughtfully constructed quiz in a fun
and interactive manner. To further enrich this experience, the workshop
will include a hands-on coloring activity, carefully curated to spotlight
key characters from the book. This aims to reinforce the children's connection
with the story, enhancing their understanding and appreciation of the narrative's
nuances. Through this multifaceted approach, the workshop aims to foster
a love for reading, stimulate imaginative thinking, and cultivate artistic
skills among its youthful participants.</p>
