Join us for the kokedama workshop to learn how you can keep plant that do not need alot of space. What is Kokedama? Kokedama is a ball of soil, covered with moss, on which an ornamental plant grows. It is a type of Japanese bonsai that is continually growing in popularity due to its unique and minimalist appearance. Also known as ‘moss ball’ and ‘string garden’, kokedama is a variant of bonsai cultivation, where plant roots are wrapped with soil and moss. It can be suspended using string, or left to sit on a piece of pottery, to be admired. However, do not limit it to simply hanging it. It also will make an impact in a clear bowl or on a wooden shelf. |
