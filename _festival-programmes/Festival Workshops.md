|27th May 2023 12:30pm - 2:30pm| **I Think I can Fly!** Flying seeds and fruits are common features in our tropical forest. They have different features that aid the trees to desperse their seeds over long distances. In this hands-on workshop, we will look at some of the different mechanisms that plants have deployed to spread their seeds as far away from their parent tree as possible. We will be using paper origami to make winged fruits to investigate how well they fly. Come fly away with us!| Please click here for more information.
