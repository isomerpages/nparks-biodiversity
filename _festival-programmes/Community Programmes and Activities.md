<p>Invasive plant species are a threat to our native ecosystems. They compete
with our local flora for water, nutrients, and space, often resulting in
a deterioration of native biodiversity. WWF-Singapore is organising monthly
invasive species management sessions at Rail Corridor, where volunteers
can help to remove weeds such as the Zanzibar Yam (Dioscorea sansibarensis).
