| 03 Jun 2023 04:00PM over zoom| **The Critically Endangered Malayan Tiger** The Malayan tiger is a unique species that had once lived in Singapore. Locally extirpated since 1930, the Malayan tiger now lives in precariously low numbers in Peninsular Malaysia. Since 2015, people living in Singapore have made their way to Pahang for Citizen Action for Tigers (CAT Walk Plus) — a project to protect tigers and restore critical habitat for wildlife. Come learn more about CAT Walk Plus and how you can be part of the efforts to save the Malayan tiger from extinction.| |
