<p>Look out for our 3 festival game stations at the Festival of Biodiversity,
where you can learn more about the rich biodiversity that can be found
in Singapore's urban areas. This year, we also have a scavenger hunt across
our festival booths and the Central Public Library. Complete all 3 game
stations and answer at least 3 questions in the scavenger hunt to win the
exclusive FoB 2025 pin!</p>
