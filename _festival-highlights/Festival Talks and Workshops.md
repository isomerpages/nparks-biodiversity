<p><strong>Adaptation and Evolution: The Secrets Behind the Success of Snakes (3pm - 4pm)</strong>
</p>
<p>Snakes are among the most diverse and successful groups of vertebrates,
with approximately 3,900 species found across every continent except Antarctica.
Despite being limbless, they have evolved remarkable adaptations that enable
them to thrive in a vast range of habitats, from the scorching sands of
the Sahara to the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia. Their specialized
morphological and behavioral traits demonstrate the extraordinary versatility
of these reptiles. This talk will explore the unique adaptations of snakes
found in Singapore and the surrounding region, highlighting how these limbless
predators have mastered their environments and continue to flourish in
both natural and urban landscapes.</p>

<p><strong>A History of Land-use Policies and Planning in Singapore by Singapore Youth Voices for Biodiversity (2pm - 4pm at Possibility Room - National Library Building, Level 5)</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore’s landscapes have seen many changes through the years - from
kampongs and plantations, to a bustling port city, and finally to the metropolis
we know today. Forests made way for roads and homes, rivers were straightened
into canals, and new neighbourhoods popped up one after another - often
at the expense of native habitats and the species they once sheltered.
But through all this, patches of wildness remain - sometimes protected,
sometimes overlooked. What gets protected, what gets moved, and what gets
lost in the name of progress? Together, we’ll reflect on how these landscapes
came to be, the policies and planning decisions that shaped them, and what
they might look like in the years to come. Join us for an afternoon of
conversation and co-learning, as we reimagine how Singapore’s green and
grey might grow side by side as we move towards becoming a City in Nature.</p>
