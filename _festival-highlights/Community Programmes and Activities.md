<p>The kingdom of Fungi, making up one of the five kingdoms of living beings,
has an estimated 3.8 million species.</p>
<p>These fungi range from edible mushrooms that routinely sprout after rain,
to fungi that exist underground for their entire lifecycle.</p>
<p>Fungi/mushrooms have been used for different medicinal purposes, be it
in traditional Chinese medicine (Eg: Gandoderma and Cordyceps) to modern
western medication (Eg: Penicillin from Penicillum chrysogenum).</p>
<p>In addition to existing independently, an estimated 80+% of existing plant
species form symbiotic relationships with fungi within their roots. Join
us for a glimpse into the fascinating fungal world.</p>
<p>This programme is held in conjunction with Republic Polytechnic.</p>

<p>Phytoplankton play a vital role in aquatic ecosystems and sequester carbon
dioxide in our atmosphere. More than 50% of our oxygen comes from phytoplankton
in the world’s oceans and lakes.</p>
<p>Understanding the role of phytoplankton in aquatic ecosystems will help
in advancing the solutions to problems facing today’s water resources,
such as harmful algal blooms, pollution, and climate change.</p>
<p>Join us in this talk as Dr Maxine Mowe shares more on phytoplankton and
how their growth and production can possibly be the solution for increasing
carbon capture globally.</p>
<p>This programme is part of a series on sustainability co-curated with the
NUS Department of Biological Sciences.</p>
<p></p>
<p>About the Speaker:</p>
<p>Dr. Maxine Mowe is a biology lecturer at the National University of Singapore
in the Department of Biological Sciences and has more than 14 years of
research experience in aquatic biology specifically in phytoplankton and
zooplankton ecology and has been a lecturer since 2019. She has worked
on the ecology of several cyanobacterial taxa (Microcystis, Raphidiopsis),
phytoplankton and zooplankton interactions, microplastic impacts and eutrophication
and algal bloom mitigation using aquatic plants in Singapore’s reservoirs
and coastal environment. She teaches various biology and ecology courses
(General Biology, Evolutionary Biology, Freshwater Biology, Plankton Ecology)
for undergraduate students and several courses (Freshwater Conservation,
Food Security and Sustainability and Internships) for the Masters’ programme
in NUS on Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainability. She is also a voluntary
committee member for Care for Creation Committee at Caritas since 1 January
2023. Together with the rest of the committee, she has planned several
environmental activities including beach clean-ups, intertidal walks, tree
planting events and workshops for adults and children.</p>

<p>In this workshop, you'll learn why biodiversity is vital for the wellbeing
&amp; preservation of our societal ecosystems. The challenge lies in balancing
urban demand for natural resources/services with a need to protect nature.</p>
<p>Through this hands-on interactive workshop, we'll unpack our interdependence
with nature &amp; how human activities are contributing to biodiversity
loss. Learn about the interconnectedness of all life on Earth. Thanks to
a science-based set of cards (based on the IPBES reports), discover the
fundamental interactions within biodiversity, the causes and consequences
of its decline. Discover how our societies and even health systems depend
very much on nature.</p>
<p>This workshop is organised in conjunction with The Biodiversity Collage
and The Transmutation Principle.</p>
<p>About The Transmutation Principle:</p>
