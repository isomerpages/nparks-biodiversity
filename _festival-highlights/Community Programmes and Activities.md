</div>
<p>The kingdom of Fungi, making up one of the five kingdoms of living beings,
has an estimated 3.8 million species.</p>
<p>These fungi range from edible mushrooms that routinely sprout after rain,
to fungi that exist underground for their entire lifecycle.</p>
<p>Fungi/mushrooms have been used for different medicinal purposes, be it
in traditional Chinese medicine (Eg: Gandoderma and Cordyceps) to modern
western medication (Eg: Penicillin from Penicillum chrysogenum).</p>
<p>In addition to existing independently, an estimated 80+% of existing plant
species form symbiotic relationships with fungi within their roots. Join
us for a glimpse into the fascinating fungal world.</p>
<p>This programme is held in conjunction with Republic Polytechnic.</p>

members to remove them from online platforms.</p>
